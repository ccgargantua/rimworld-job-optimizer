# Rimworld Job Optimizer (WIP)
Optimize the jobs of colonists in rimworld based on their stats using a genetic algorithm.

## DISCLAIMER
This software is a work in progress and currently functions poorly. This is because it only accounts for the colonists' skills for performing particular jobs. I do not recommend using this in its current state.
